# Python Fundamentals
 This repository contains fundamental projects and codebases in python which are updated from time to time

## app.py
- This is a simple pyton backend using flask

## gpa_function.py
- This takes a list of courses taking by a student including the couse name and the grade and assigns a gpa to each course

## leap%year.py and leapYearV2.py
- Takes a year as input and determines if it was a leap year or an end of century leap year or not

## PrimeNumbers.py
- This takes a start point and an end point, generates numbers within the range, finds the prime numbers, how many of them they are and their sum,

## SDV2.py
- This is for calculating the mean, mean devation, population and sample variances of grouped or ungrouped data from inputs it takes


## Starting up
- First run this in your terminal
  ```cpp
    git clone 'https://github.com/michaelperryjnr/python-Fundamentals.git' && cd python-Fundamentals/
  ```

- To run any of the files:
    - First have python installed then
    ```cpp
        python filename.py
    ```
    - An example is `python SDV2.py` or `python leapYearV2.py`
